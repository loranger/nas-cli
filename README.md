# Nas
nas utility to sync files from local machine to server

I usually have to upload new downloaded file from my local machine to my nas (and make them available to my whole LAN, Sonos or TV).

I used to use sync tools such as [FolderSync](http://www.destek.co.uk/foldersync2/), [Good Sync](https://www.goodsync.com/) ou [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) but remains fed up with instabilities, constant broken upgrade (good sync, I stares at you), residual files, or mandatory daemon on destination serverâ€¦

I'm now back to the roots, and uses rsync, but I setup a simple wrapper in order to trigger a sync whenever I need it

Paths to sync, are stored as json inside `~/.nas` file
